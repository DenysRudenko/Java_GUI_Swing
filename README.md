### Lab1

## Lab1Part1
Create a Java class called Lab1Part1. Extend this class from the JFrame class (remember
to import javax.swing). Make the frame 600 pixels wide and 300 pixels high. Carry out the
following operations on the JFrame you can go to the Oracle website or another web
source to find the correct method to use if needed:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/index.html?javax/swing/JFrame.html:

a) Set the location of the frame to 500, 500 on the screen (clue setLocation)
b) Make the frame so it is NOT resizable (clue setResizable)
c) Set the top of the frame to display your full name (clue: setTitle)
d) Create a variable called contentPane and assign it to the content pane of the
JFrame (clue getContentPane method)
e) Make sure the frame is set to visible (clue setVisible)
• Create class and ‘extends’ JFrame (4 points)
• Set location (3 points)
• Set Title to your full name (3 points)
• Set resizable (NOT resizable) (3 points)
• Set size and visibility of the JFrame (3 points)
• Set the variable contentPane to reference content pane of JFrame (4 points)

## Lab1Part2
Create a Java SWING JFrame (extends JFrame) class called Lab1Part2. Set the size of the
frame to whatever you wish (at least 100 x 100). Create a JPanel called labelHolderPanel.
Create THREE JLabels. Call the first JLabel labelNoImage and set the text in the label to
“Label with no image”. Call the second JLabel imageLabel and set the icon (clue: setIcon)
for the label to some small image of your choice (If the image is too big it will take up the
whole interface). Set the text of the second label to “Label with image”. Add a third label
with a picture of your choice (again not too big) and label what the picture shows by
setting the text. Call the third JLabel myImageChoiceLabel. Add ALL labels to the JPanel
called labelHolderPanel and add the panel to the content frame of the JFrame.

## Lab1Part3
Create a JFrame SWING class called Lab1Part3. One of the guiding principles to good GUI
design is familiarity, i.e., give the user what they are used to using (e.g., show images for
icons they expect). However, for the purposes of this lab we will deliberately break this
principle. Reinvent the icons used for “Save” and “Open”, “Delete” and “Undo”. Create a
panel called buttonPanel. Create FOUR JButtons and set an icon for each. Create a save
button that will have text “Save” and a new icon for save (you can be imaginative with the
icon but keep the icon small enough, so the button is not huge). Create an open button
with a new icon to represent “Open” and the text “Open” (again you can be imaginative
but keep it small). Create a delete button with a new icon to represent “Delete” with text
“Delete” (again you can be imaginative but keep it small). Create an undo button with a
new icon to represent “Undo” and text “Undo” (again you can be imaginative but keep it
small). Add ALL buttons to the panel and add the panel to the content pane of the frame.

## Lab1Part4
Create a JFrame SWING class called Lab1Part4. Make the frame large enough to hold
several components. Create a frame that either describes yourself or a pet dog/cat/animal
and include a picture with a label [Note: If you don’t have a pet or don’t want to describe
yourself then pick something else unique to yourself to construct the JFrame about, e.g.,
favourite car, pastime, possession, sport achievement etc.]. Carry out the following with
the JFrame:
a. Set the title of the frame to “About Me” or “About my Pet”
b. Create a JPanel called holderPanel to hold ALL components
c. Create a JTextField with your name or pet name in it
d. Create a JTextArea and add a small description of what is featured (you or your
pet etc.)
e. Create a JLabel with a picture of you or the pet etc. and set the text of the label
with a nice font to “This is me” or “This is my pet” etc.
f. Create a JButton with the text “Like” and a small thumbs up icon
g. ADD ALL OF THE COMPONENTS TO THE PANEL
h. Add the panel to the content pane of the JFrame
